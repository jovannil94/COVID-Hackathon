The Covid Near Us App is a quick solution to the person who needs to travel and keeps them informed about each state in one app.When launched immediately shows Covid-19 stats for the United States. It offers a search by state on the landing page. Once a state has been selected, the user is taken to the search result page that gives hospitalization stats, infected cases, and deaths. Also below the search results you can find a testing site “near us” to send the user to a testing site using geolocation. Once the area is selected by address, the user is taken to the Testing site in that location for 3 sites that have testing options for that user. It gives the user the address and phone number to contact testing facilities. The address results can redirect you to Maps as well.
